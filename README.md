## My Project
  Write a script to get a path from the user, make a backup, compress it, and send it to storage. I use an AWS S3 bucket for storage, but you can use AWS S3 or MinIO in on-prem environments.
## How can you use the project
* First you have to create a bucket in AWS S3, create a user and assign the AmazonS3FullAccess policy to the user.
* You need generate a Key for the user, then you have Access Key ID and Secret Access Key.
* Open terminal on your system and add that key with ‘AWS configure’.
